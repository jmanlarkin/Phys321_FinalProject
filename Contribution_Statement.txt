During the first week, Jonathan and Shilin both did the coding. Jonathan worked on the Monte Carlo
for simulating the elections while Shilin worked on building a MCMC framework to get posterior distributions
from the data.

During the second week, Jonathan did most of the coding (debugging likelihood, download data, running simulations).
Shilin got started with the final report.

During the last week, Jonathan ran the simulation for one last time and both worked on the final report.
