# Phys321_FinalProject
Repository for Phys 321 final project on presidential election modeling. 

The only files we want to be graded on are:
Modeling.ipynb and montecarlo.py and of course the final report pdf.

Jonathan also has the .csv file containing the simulation results locally.
The size of the file is about 1GB and it is too big to be pushed on Github.
Please let us know if you want to see it.
